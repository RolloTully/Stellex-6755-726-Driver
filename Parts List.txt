All resistors are 1%
All Caps are 16v or higher
LTC1044 can be substitued by a LMC7660 with degraded performance

you may wish to get spares of the everything, at best you can replace burn out parts, at worst you have enought spares to make a second driver board


PARTS LISTS:

1x Order of Driver board, generaly the minimum order is of 5.

1x Stellex 6755-726 or Endwave MY01210 (This can be found on ebay)

-Resistors:
3x 5k multiturn resistors
1x 240 Ohm
1x 2.7K
1x 3.0K
1x 10K
2x 100 Ohm
2x 10 Ohm 1W
1x 15 Ohm 1W
1x 680 Ohm
1x 470 Ohm
1x 2K

-Caps:
4x 100pF
1x 100uF
1x 470uF
A bunch of 10 uF maybe 20(IDFN, im some how too lazy to count but not too lazy to write out this whole speal about how im too lazy)

-Diodes:
1x 1N5401
2x 1N4001
4x 1N4148

-MOSFETS:
2x IRF510

-Other:
1x LM317
1x LTC1044 (or LMC7660)
2x OP27G (replacing the older LM627)
4x 8 pin dip sockets (optional if you want to risk your ICs)
1x right angle pcb to sma connector
1x SMA passthrough of your choosing depending on how you want to get the signal out of the box 
1x 12v 2.5mm pcb connector
1x Decent 12v Power supply, get a good one, a noise 12v supply will effect the stability of the circuit. if you cant you can always run it off of a battery
