All resistors are 1%
All Caps are 16v or higher
LTC1044 can be substitued by a LMC7660 with degraded performance

you may wish to get spares of the everything, at best you can replace burn out parts, at worst you have enought spares to make a second driver board


PARTS LISTS:

1x Order of Driver board, generaly the minimum order is of 5.

1x Stellex 6755-726 or Endwave MY01210 (This can be found on ebay)

-Resistors:
3x 5k multiturn resistors  -> R1
1x 240 Ohm      ->  R2
1x 2.7K	    ->  R3
1x 3.0K         ->  R4
1x 10K          ->  R5
2x 100 Ohm      ->  R6
2x 10 Ohm 1W    ->  R7
1x 15 Ohm 1W    ->  R8
1x 680 Ohm      ->  R9
1x 470 Ohm      ->  R10
1x 2K           ->  R11

-Caps:
4x 100pF   -> C1
1x 100uF   -> C2
1x 470uF   -> C3
A bunch of 10 uF maybe 20(IDFN, im some how too lazy to count but not too lazy to write out this whole speal about how im too lazy. anyways its pcb ID is)   -> C4


-Diodes:
1x 1N5401    -> D1
2x 1N4001    -> D2
4x 1N4148    -> D3

-MOSFETS:
2x IRF510   -> M1

-Other:
1x LM317     
1x LTC1044 (or LMC7660) -> IC1
2x OP27G (replacing the older LM627)    -> IC2
4x 8 pin dip sockets (optional if you want to risk your ICs)
1x right angle pcb to sma connector   -> SMA
1x SMA passthrough of your choosing depending on how you want to get the signal out of the box 
1x 12v 2.5mm pcb connector -> 12V
1x Decent 12v Power supply, get a good one, a noise 12v supply will effect the stability of the circuit. if you cant you can always run it off of a battery
